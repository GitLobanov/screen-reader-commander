/imagine prompt: A dense, overgrown jungle landscape on an alien planet, where colossal stone ruins from an ancient civilization are partially hidden beneath thick vines and moss. The ruins consist of towering, broken stone arches, and crumbling statues with glowing, mystical symbols. Strange, bioluminescent plants and enormous, alien trees dominate the environment, their leaves glowing faintly in shades of blue and purple. The air is thick with mist, and faint traces of the civilization's past technology can be seen embedded in the jungle's flora. The background shows faint glimpses of a darkened sky through the towering trees, with a distant, massive planet hanging in view.
/imagine prompt: A hidden cavern beneath a massive waterfall on an alien jungle planet. The entrance to the cavern is obscured by the cascading water, and the surrounding jungle is filled with vibrant, glowing flora and towering alien trees. Inside, the cavern opens into a massive, luminous chamber, where glowing crystals are embedded in the walls, casting a soft light over the ancient carvings that cover the stone. The floor is a mix of natural stone and forgotten machinery from a long-lost civilization, overgrown with moss and vines. Strange, hovering creatures and bioluminescent insects float through the air, illuminating the dark depths.
